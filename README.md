# Cloud Unicorn Rides Project

## Overview

🚀 Welcome to my Cloud Unicorn Rides project! In this hands-on venture, I ventured into the captivating world of cloud computing, constructing a Serverless Web Application using a robust stack of AWS services. This README provides an overview of the project's key components and accomplishments.

## Project Highlights are :

### 🌐 Hosted a Static Website with AWS Amplify
Mastered the art of effortlessly hosting static web resources—HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images—using AWS Amplify. A sleek and user-friendly interface is just a deployment away.

### 🔐 Managed Users with Amazon Cognito
Implemented robust user management and authentication functions via Amazon Cognito, ensuring the security of the backend API. Privacy and data integrity take center stage for user interactions.

### 📡 Built a Serverless Backend with Amazon DynamoDB
Leveraged Amazon DynamoDB to create a resilient persistence layer for the application's data. The serverless architecture guarantees scalability and cost-effectiveness.

### 🚀 Deployed a RESTful API with Amazon API Gateway
Utilized the prowess of Amazon API Gateway to expose the AWS Lambda function as a RESTful API. Users can effortlessly submit ride requests, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Application Workflow

1. **User Requests Unicorn Ride:**
   - Users access the HTML-based interface to specify their pickup location.
   - A RESTful web service on the backend processes the request.

2. **Backend Processing:**
   - AWS Lambda, powered by Amazon API Gateway, handles user requests.
   - Data is stored in Amazon DynamoDB for a reliable persistence layer.

3. **Unicorn Dispatch:**
   - The application dispatches a nearby unicorn to fulfill the ride request.
